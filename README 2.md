> [!WARNING]
> This branch contains major changes from the rebase of Launcher3, including breaking changes that can cause Lawnchair to break.
> 
> If you wish to contribute, read our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). This branch will undergo many changes as we slowly refactor our codebase, so the `16-dev` branch may be particularly unfriendly to new contributors.
> 
> For regular users, we recommend staying on **Lawnchair 15 Beta 2**.

Lawnchair is a free, open-source home app for Android. Taking Launcher3—Android’s default home app—as a starting point, it ports Pixel Launcher features and introduces rich customization options.

This branch houses the codebase of Lawnchair 16, which is currently in development and is based on Launcher3 from Android 16. For Lawnchair 9 to 15, see the branches with the `9-` to `15-` prefixes, respectively.

## Features

-   **Material Expressive Theming:** Adapts to your wallpaper and system theme.
-   **At a Glance Widget:** Displays information *at a glance* with support for [Smartspacer](https://github.com/KieronQuinn/Smartspacer).
-   **QuickSwitch Support:** Integrates with Android Recents on Android 10-15 (requires root).
-   **Global Search:** Allows quick access to apps, contacts, and web results from the home screen.
-   **Customization Options:** Provides options to tweak icons, fonts, and colors to your liking.
-   And more!
