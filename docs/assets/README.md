# Lawnchair Assets Guidelines

This directory lists all the decoration & visual explainers used in the Lawnchair Documentation.

All assets created should use Material 3 design with `#47B84F` as source color, and
the [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) ([OFL v1.1](https://github.com/rsms/inter/?tab=OFL-1.1-1-ov-file#readme))
typography. 

Visit the [Material 3 theme builder][material-theme-builder] for more information on color.

## Device mockup

When creating device mockups for Lawnchair, make sure the latest stable commits of Lawnchair is use 
as base. All wallpapers, fonts and icon packs are allowed as long as they're free-to-use 
under a permissive license like the licenses from Creative-Common. Using vanilla out-of-the-box 
experience is recommended because they show the user what to expect from Lawnchair Launcher when 
they first use it.
